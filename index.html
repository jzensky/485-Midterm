        &#9733 Welcome to my Midterm Project for HCDE 485: Bias in Algorithms. &#9733 <br> <br>
        In this project, I explore the question: <em>What if it was simpler to be a good person?</em>

        To explore this question, I created a simple web application that encourages users to perform random acts of kindness. The app provides daily suggestions for kind actions, tracks the user's progress, and offers positive reinforcement through badges and rewards.
        <br><br>
        The goal of this project is to demonstrate how technology can be designed to promote positive behavior and make it easier for individuals to contribute to a kinder society.
        <br><br>
        Feel free to explore the app and share your thoughts on how we can make kindness a more integral part of our daily lives!
      </p>-->

    <h3>Final Reflection </h3>
    <p> It can feel nearly impossible to understand how to be a completely good person all the time. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I started this project based on my own curiosity and frustrations with the intricacies of trying to be a good person, and how we define "good" and "bad" habits.
      When working with the data I collected, I realized that, even when trying to implement my own fictional moral definitions, I kept getting stuck on the nuances of capitalism, human behavior and their effects on the world around us.
      However, I realized that this was part of the point of the project - to explore how complex and multifaceted our definitions of morality are, and how difficult it can be to navigate them in our daily lives. </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      This fictional world, where an omnipotent moral governance tracks and rewards what it deems "good behavior", 
      presents a thought experiment on how we currently define the moral good, and how technology could and does influence human behavior and societal norms. 
      While everyone has their own biases and perspectives, social media and societal infrastructures often amplify certain moral standards and expectations, which can lead to a narrow and harmful view of what it means to be a "good" person.
      In reality, no one entity can truly define morality for everyone, as it is a deeply personal and subjective concept that varies across cultures, religions, and individual beliefs.
      However, especially as the world keeps going down its dark paths, I wonder if such a system could work to enforce moral standards that promote the common good, and help encourage people to think more critically about their actions and their impact on others.
      While the idea of being constantly monitored for moral behavior without explanation is unsettling, 
      the incentives provided by such a system could potentially encourage actions and beliefs that would promote a more peaceful, prosperous world.
      However, it also raises additional ethical questions about privacy, autonomy, and the definition of "good" behavior.
      Overall, this project has prompted me to think critically about how moral standards are defined and implemented, and the role of technology in shaping our values and actions as individuals and as a society.

    <p><em> Disclaimer/Positionality Acknowledgement: This idea (omnipotent moral governance) is similar to many religious and spiritual beliefs. 
      As someone who has primarily practiced religion in the context of cultural traditions and expectations rather than personal beliefs, this concept remains “fictional” to me, personally. 
      I do not intend to discredit or dismiss any personal, spiritual, or religious beliefs. </em></p>
